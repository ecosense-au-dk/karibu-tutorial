Karibu Hello World: Getting data into the EcoSense backtier
=======

Version 3 / August 2013.

This document summarizes the programming process involved in developing the
client side software, and the backend plug-in, to allow clients
to send data to the EcoSense backend for storage. It is based upon
the developed framework called *Karibu*. (Karibu is Swahili for "welcome").


*NOTE*: The Karibu system is stabilizing but minor mistakes in this
document is to be expected...

Overview of the process
----

Below I will describe a *staged testing process* which strives to
emphasize agile software development **fast development of reliable
software** . The staging involves
three stages:

1. Make your core client side and backend side software work in a
*single node environment* (validates your code in a non-distributed
environment.) Karibu is designed to allow you to build the entire
client side user interface and domain logic in this environment thus
speeding up development significantly!

2. Make your configuration code work in a *distributed test
environment* (validates most of the RabbitMQ and Mongo parameters and
configurations as well as tests your client in a real distributed
environment but without fear of interferring with the full operational
system.)

3. Deploy your backend code on the *pre-production CS system*. This
allows realistic testing is a safe environment that never-the-less
is similar to the operational environment.

4. Final deployment in the operational system. The 
CS EcoSense administrator (Henrik BÃ¦rbak)
must be involved of the final deployment.



Architecture Overview
======================

The Component and Connector view shows the run-time architecture of
Karibu in the distributed operational environment:

![Component-Connector view](resource/cc-view.gif)

(The notation is explained in [Christensen et al.], but briefly boxes
represent passive run-time objects; boxes with vertical lines at the sides
represent active objects (run-time processes); and a second frame behind states
there are many of the particular object.) 

The objects are colour-coded: white are those developed by the client
application (that is: your fantastic app), dark gray are default
implementations provided by Karibu; light gray are objects you must
develop to configure Karibu for your particular usage; blue are 3rd
party components; and finally the green object is a variability point
which can be configured with various default implementations.

The typical use case is the client sending one data collection object
to the backend for storage. This use case is shown in the following
sequence diagram:

![Send scenario](resource/seq-send.gif)

Your application produces a data object, and you call the `send`
method of the Karibu ClientRequestHandler object. It will use your
injected Serializer to convert your data object into a binary payload
suitable for transport, and next use a ChannelConnector to send it to
the backend. The default ChannelConnector for operational mode is a
RabbitMQ client that will send it to a RabbitMQ cluster at CS.

(Backend processing description pending... Short version: The storage
daemon receives binary payload as they are received by the RabbitMQ;
it deserializes it using your provided deserializer (binary to MongoDB
JSON object format) and will ask the Storage object to store it. The
default Storage object will insert the object as a new document into
database `ecosense` in the collection named by the producer code.)

Download and Tool chain
=======================

To compile and execute, you need *Java JDK*, *Apache Ant* and *Apache Ivy*
for dependency management. You also need network access to download
modules that Karibu depends upon.

If you just want to use Karibu, you can just configure Ivy to fetch
the relevant Karibu modules from our team repository server:
`twiga.cs.au.dk`.

In the 'dependencies' section of your ivy.xml, 
   ask for the karibu-producer module:

    <dependency org="ecosense" name="karibu-producer"
    rev="latest.integration" />

and ensure that the twiga server is in the chain of ivy resolvers:

  <property name="ivy.shared.default.root"             
	    value="http://twiga.cs.au.dk:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local" 
	    override="false"/>


Alternatively, you can get full code and development access: Use 'git'
to get access to Karibu, using the following link:

https://github.com/ecosense-au-dk/Karibu

(Require that you are registered Ecosense user.)

Stage 1: Developing in the single-node environment
==================================

**This is the recommended mode for developing the GUI and application
  logic as you avoid a distributed environment all together**

The process for the client side developer requires three steps for
successful uploading data to the backtier:

1. Develop and test the serialization and deserialization implementation
2. Configure the Karibu framework's client side objects
3. Configure the Karibu framework's backend objects for single-node development

Below the three process steps are examplified on a very simple "Hello
World" data model. Please refer to the JUnit example code in
`karibu-tutorial/test/cs/ecosense/helloworld/stage1/TestRoundtrip.java`
which contains all the code shown below.

The JUnit test cases are executed (along with other test cases) by
issuing 'ant test' in the `karibu-tutorial` subfolder.

Step 1: Serialization and deserialization step
-------------

Your client's data objects must be serialized into a byte
array for transmission to the backend, and deserialized into
a MongoDB BSON object. I advice to develop these using
normal test-driven development and JUnit:

  1. Create an object of your client side data type.
  2. Test-drive develop an implementation of the Karibu `Serializer`
  interface using asserts on the binary output format. The serializer
  is responsible for producing a byte array representing the format
  used 'on the wire'.
  3. Test-drive develop an implementation of the Karibu `Deserializer`
  interface by using the binary output of the previous step as input,
  and validate the structure of the output MongoDB JSON object.
  The deserializer is used in the backend to convert from the byte
  array to the MongoDB object that should be stored.

### Example

An example client side domain class,
`ExampleDomainClass`, is defined as

    /* An example of a domain class */
    class ExampleDomainClass {
      private String name;
      private String game;
    
      public ExampleDomainClass(String name, String favoriteComputerGame) {
        this.name = name;
        this.game = favoriteComputerGame;
      }
    
      public String getName() {
        return name;
      }
    
      public String getGame() {
        return game;
      }
    }

Next we settle on a binary format that codes the two string
parameters as a sequence of bytes, with a `|` as separator between
the two strings.

The code below illustrates the (resulting) test case that was used to
drive the implementation of `Serializer` and `Deserializer`
implementations. The setup() method has defined the object `ex` as

    ex = new ExampleDomainClass("Henrik", "StarCraft II");    

which is used in the test case below.

The resulting JUnit test case becomes:

    @Test
    public void shouldHaveIdemPotentSerialization() {
      Serializer<ExampleDomainClass> theSerializer = 
          new ExampleSerializer();
    
      // Serialize the domain object into a byte array
      // for on the wire transmission
      byte[] onTheWirePayload = theSerializer.serialize(ex);
    
      // Smoketest that the serialization is proper
      assertNotNull( onTheWirePayload );
    
      assertEquals( 'H', onTheWirePayload[0]);
      assertEquals( 'k', onTheWirePayload[5]);
      assertEquals( '|', onTheWirePayload[6]);
      assertEquals( 'S', onTheWirePayload[7]);
      assertEquals( 'C', onTheWirePayload[11]);
      assertEquals( 't', onTheWirePayload[15]);
    
      // Next, deserialize it into a MongoDB BSON object
      Deserializer theDeserializer = new ExampleDeserializer();
       
      BasicDBObject dbo = theDeserializer.buildDocumentFromByteArray(onTheWirePayload);
    
      // And smoketest that indeed the mongo object corresponds to
      // the original client side object
      assertNotNull(dbo);
    
      assertEquals("Henrik", dbo.get("name"));
      assertEquals("StarCraft II", dbo.get("game"));
    }
  
  
You may use any technique to serialize and deserialize, like using
open source JSON modules, Google protocol buffers, or hand code it all
by yourself. The `karibu-test` contains test cases that uses a JSON
serializer 'org.codehaus.jackson' for inspiration.
    
Assuming that you have a decent test suite that validates that your
serialization and deserialization works ok, you can move on to the
next step.

* NOTE: MongoDB cannot store objects whose key fields contain '.'
  (dots). Ensure that your serialization does not produce
  such. (Beware for automatic serialization of inner objects as they
  likely will use dot-notation.) *

Step 2. Client side Karibu objects
-------------

In this step, we configure the Karibu client side framework objects to
transmit the data object to the backend tier. 

In this section we avoid the RabbitMQ connector, and instead use
Karibu's test implementations that allow a full upload to be
*simulated* in a single process in-memory setup. This is designed to
allow speedy development of the client side without having to setup a
distributed environment. The Stage 2 section later in the document
will demonstrate Karibu's RabbitMQ implementation meant for production
code.

Thus the run-time view mimics the production environment but with
important differences as shown in the component connector view below.
    
![Component-Connector  view for test](resource/cc-view-test.gif)

Basically, you instantiate a `StandardClientRequestHandler` from the
Karibu framework, and use itsx `send` method to upload data to the
backend. This default class provides retry-and-failover code which
means it will repeatedly attempt upload in case the connection has
been lost, and in the full production environment it will also
failover to a secondary RabbitMQ in case the primary is down.

The client request handler is an architectural pattern, described in
POSA volume 4. In Karibu, you configure the client request handler
with four parameters
  
  1. The domain class type (as a generic type)
  2. The project code (explained below)
  3. The channel connector to use (the transport medium, explained below)
  4. The serializer to use (the one we defined in the previous step).

The snippet of JUnit code (test method `shouldStoreASentObject()`)
from the example looks like this:

    private final static String EXAMPLE_PRODUCER_CODE = "EXMXX001"; 

    ClientRequestHandler<ExampleDomainClass> crh =  
        new StandardClientRequestHandler<ExampleDomainClass>( 
            EXAMPLE_PRODUCER_CODE,  
            connector, new ExampleSerializer()); 

Below we dig into details of the project code and the channel
connector.
 
### The project code semantics
    
Message queue systems do not retain information about the producer of
a message. Thus for the backend to know how to deserialize the payload
and to know which collection to store the object in, you have to
identify yourself as producer of the data. This is done using the
*project code*: the producer's unique ID.

In Karibu the project code is exactly 8 characters (UTF-8) that
uniquely must identify the producer as well as what version of the
data is sent.

The format is defined as 

    // Karibu uses a 8 character (UTF-8) code to 
    // identify the producer of data, called 
    // a 'producer-code' [The pattern 
    // "format indicator" in Hohpe and Woolf 2003] 
    // Format of codes: PPPTTVVV 
    // PPP = Three letter identifying the sub project, GFK for grundfos dorm, etc. 
    // TT = Two letter identifying the type of produced data, RE for reading, SC for sensor characteristica 
    // VVV = Three digit version identifier 
     
Example: `GFKRE003` defines the producer of data as the grundfos dorm,
the data type is 'reading', and finally the version of the data sent
as 3.

### The channel connector

The client request handler must know which channel connector to use. The
connector is the transport medium and a standard RabbitMQ
implementation is used in production; however one may envision other
transports such as HTTP etc.

A connector must implement the interface `ChannelConnector`
interface.

For testing, an implementation that uses simple in-memory method
calls is provided by Karibu. From the test code:

    // Create the client side objects - these objects must always 
    // be defined for clients 
    ChannelConnector connector; 
    // Here we use an in-memory connector, a normal client shall 
    // instead use the RabbitMessageProducer connector 
    connector = new InVMInterProcessConnector(srh); 
 
(The `srh` object is a stub for the backend, and explained below
in the backend section.)

### Sending the data object

Given a correctly configured client request handler, the actual
sending is simple - just call the `send` method and supply the object
itself, as well as a *topic*. The topic defines 'what we are talking
about' and must follow some rules for the backend to interpret it
correctly, see below.

Thus the code is:

    // Client side 'normal operations' is just sending data to
    // the server   
    try {
      crh.send(ex, "exampleproject.reading.store");
    } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }

Note that an IOException may occur which of course tell you that the
send has failed. Currently, the send actually implements *fail-over*
semantics and a retry is attempted to send to another rabbit in the
cluster. 

The second parameter of the `send` defines the topic. The topic
concept is explained in detail in "RabbitMQ in Action" and RabbitMQ
tutorial on the web. In Karibu the topic must have a specific format
as outlined in the JavaDoc for `send`.

    * Topics are strings on the form "A.B.C", that is,
    * three parts separated by dot.
    * A = name of experiment/client/project; example "grundfos".
    * B = type of the data; example "reading".
    * C = type of backend processing; example "store".

**Note: The production backend at CS is configured to only store
objects sent with "store" as the C part of the topic** 

Step 3. Backend Karibu objects
-------------

In a distributed enviroment, the backend karibu objects are of course
configured by the backend services. However, the test
implemenations allows us to set them up for local single machine
testing. This is explained in this section.

The backend requires three things to be set up:

  * Implementation of the `Storage` - the database to store MongoDB
  objects in.
  * The `DeserializerFactory` which is a sort of Abstract Factory 
  which returns a proper Deserializer object based upon the provided
  project code 
  * The `ServerRequestHandler` which is the backend match for the
  ClientRequestHandler (again a POSA Vol. 4 pattern).

A standard implementation `StandardServerRequestHandler` is provided
by Karibu which is just configured by the storage and the deserializer
factory.
    
For the storage we use a fake object that just remembers the last
stored object; and as our test case only knows a single project code
there is little need for a fancy factory of deserializers:

    // Create a fake object storage
    FakeObjectStorage storage = new FakeObjectStorage();
    // Create the factory which the server side uses to
    // lookup the deserializer
    DeserializerFactory factory = new DeserializerFactory() {
      @Override
      public Deserializer createDeserializer(String projectCode) {
        // Ignore the code as we only operate in test environment
        return new ExampleDeserializer();
      }
    };
    // Create a server side request handler
    ServerRequestHandler srh = new StandardServerRequestHandler(storage, factory);

Here you see the definition of the `srh` object that was used in the 


### Complete JUnit client side test 

      @Test
      public void shouldStoreASentObject() {
        // First, for the sake of testing, we have to create the
        // server side stub and fake objects. THIS IS NOT PART
        // OF PRODUCTION CLIENT SIDE DEVELOPMENT. See the
        // Hello World documentation!
        
        // Create a fake object storage
        FakeObjectStorage storage = new FakeObjectStorage();
        // Create the factory which the server side uses to
        // lookup the deserializer
        DeserializerFactory factory = new DeserializerFactory() {
          @Override
          public Deserializer createDeserializer(String projectCode) {
            // Ignore the code as we only operate in test environment
            return new ExampleDeserializer();
          }
        };
        // Create a server side request handler
        ServerRequestHandler srh = new StandardServerRequestHandler(storage, factory);
        // === End of creating server side objects
        
        // === CLIENT SIDE
        // Create the client side objects - these objects must always
        // be defined for clients
        InterProcessMessageProducer connector;
        // Here we use an in-memory connector, a normal client shall
        // instead use the RabbitMessageProducer connector
        connector = new InVMInterProcessConnector(srh);
        // Configure the actual 'sender' object. It requires a
        // unique 6-character long project code to identify the
        // sender of data (see HelloWorld tutorial for a description
        // of the format); which connector to use to send
        // the data; and of course which serializer to use
        // to create the byte array payload to send over the wire.
        ClientRequestHandler<ExampleDomainClass> crh = 
            new StandardClientRequestHandler<ExampleDomainClass>("EXMT01", 
                connector, new ExampleSerializer());
        
        // Client side 'normal operations' is just sending data to
        // the server   
        try {
          crh.send(ex, "exampleproject.reading.store");
        } catch (IOException e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
        }
    
        // Validate that the object has been stored in the data storage
        BasicDBObject dboStored = storage.lastDocumentStored();
        assertEquals("Henrik", dboStored.get("name"));
      }
    


Stage 2: A distributed test environment
==================

In this stage we start using the real RabbitMQ implementations for the
`ChannelConnector`, and use a backend implementation, in a distributed
test environment.

You will find the associated (manual) test code in
`karibu-tutorial/test/cs/ecosense/helloworld/stage2`. The two main programs are
`Producer` and `Consumer` and these are run through ant targets `prod`
and `cons` respectively.
 
You need to have a RabbitMQ server running for the tests to succeed
(you may use your development machine to act as both producer, consumer and
rabbit mq server).

If you want to avoid the hazzle of installing RabbitMQ and Erlang, you
can use Baerbak's "Tembo" machine if you are inside the CS
firewall. Currently, it has IP 10.11.108.61 - if it has changed,
please try to inspect the mq.ip property in the Ant build file which
is probably updated. Open your web browser on port 55672 or 15672 on
that IP and log in using 'guest'/'guest' to go to the RabbitMQ
Dashboard. Here you can monitor messages flowing in and out of the
Rabbit. 

* Before doing so, consult Henrik BÃ¦rbak, as the machine has to be
clear of other experiments for your use*.

Alternatively, Henrik BÃ¦rbak has a set of VWWare virtual machines
that you can experiment with.

The ant targets point to this machine. If you run the rabbit MQ server
on some other machine, you have to tell Ant through the `mq.ip` property:

    ant -Dmq.ip=my.machine.ip prod
    ant -Dmq.ip=my.machine.ip cons
    
Please note that running the producer and consumer will have lasting
side effects on the RabbitMQ server (similar to real production!).
If you run the `ant prod` on a fresh RabbitMQ server without having ever
run the `ant cons` then the transmitted messages are lost. This is because
it is the consumer side that defines the queues and tells them to
be 'durable'. Once a consumer has been run once, the RabbitMQ server
will remember that the queue is durable until the server is either
reinstalled or you manually remove the queue using the dashboard.

### Client configuration using RabbitMQ

The setup is of course similar to Stage 1 explained above; the only
change is the implementations to use. Basically it is just the
`connector` which is replaced by its `RabbitMessageProducer`
implementation. The code below is from the `Producer` application.

    ChannelConnector connector = null; 
    // Define the characteristics of the exchange on the Rabbit MQ. 
    RabbitExchangeConfiguration rec = 
        new ExampleExchangeConfiguration(rabbitMQServerName); 
    
    // And try to instantiate the connector 
    try { 
      connector = new RabbitChannelConnector( rec ); 
    } catch (IOException e) { 
      e.printStackTrace(); 
    } 
    // Next configure the client request handler 
    ClientRequestHandler<ExampleDomainClass> crh; 
    crh = new StandardClientRequestHandler<ExampleDomainClass>(ExampleCodes.EXAMPLE_PRODUCER_CODE,  
        connector, new ExampleSerializer()); 

The only difference is that the constructor of RabbitMessageProducer
may throw an IOException; and that you have to configure the Rabbit
Exchange using `RabbitExchangeConfiguration`. The
`ExampleExchangeConfiguration` uses default parameters for the rabbit
regarding username, password, port, and exchange configurations.

### Backend configuration using RabbitMQ

Again, the backend configuration is very similar to Stage 1. From the
`Consumer`application:

    // As storage, we use a null storage that simply outputs to the shell 
    Storage database; 
    database = new ExampleShellOutputNullStorage(); 
       
    // No fancy factory for deserializers, we know the single one 
    // that must be used. 
    DeserializerFactory factory = new DeserializerFactory() { 
      @Override 
      public Deserializer createDeserializer(String producerCode) { 
        Deserializer returnvalue = null; 
        if ( producerCode.equals(ExampleCodes.EXAMPLE_PRODUCER_CODE)) { 
          returnvalue = new ExampleDeserializer(); 
        } else { 
          log.error("Requested deserializer for unknown producer code: "+producerCode); 
        } 
        return returnvalue; 
      } 
    }; 
 
    // Create the server side request handler, injecting the 
    // two delegates that configures it. 
    ServerRequestHandler messageHandler =  
        new StandardServerRequestHandler(database, factory); 

However, one additional step is necessary, as we have to start a
receiver thread which can feed received messages into the
ServerRequestHandler. This is expressed by the class
`MessageReceiverEndpoint` and interface `PollingConsumer` (again
patterns from Hohpe and Woolf). The MessageReceiverEndpoint provides
server side failover and reconnect code in case of loosing connection;
and the PollingConsumer provides the blocking `nextDelivery()` method
that retrieves messages from the RabbitMQ. Thus it must of course be
configured for the proper exchanges and queues of the RabbitMQ,
handled by a RabbitExchangeConfiguration (same as in the client side!)
and in addition a queue configuration `RabbitQueueConfiguration`.

    // Configure the rabbit exchange and queue 
    RabbitExchangeConfiguration rec =  
        new ExampleExchangeConfiguration(rabbitMQServerName); 
    RabbitQueueConfiguration rqc =  
        new StandardStorageQueueConfiguration(); 
 
    // Configure and create the MessageReceiverEndpoint, 
    // using a RabbitMQ as polling consumer 
    PollingConsumer pollingConsumer = 
        new RabbitMQPollingConsumer( rec, rqc); 
    // .... and configure it and spawn the thread 
    MessageReceiverEndpoint receiverEndpoint =  
        new MessageReceiverEndpoint(pollingConsumer, messageHandler); 
     
    // Finally, spawn the thread ... 
    Thread receiverThread = new Thread( receiverEndpoint, "ReceiverThread" ); 
    System.out.println("Start receiving payloads. Hit Ctrl-C to terminate..."); 
     
    receiverThread.start(); 
    receiverThread.join(); // delay main thread until receiver endpoint terminates. 

Stage 3: Pre-Production environment
============

CS has a publicly available RabbitMQ server, ecosensemqtest01.cs.au.dk,
that can be used for pre-production end-2-end testing.

In this setup, your serializers for the backend MUST have been created
as a versioned ivy module and uploaded to the Ecosense Artifactory
server on twiga.cs.au.dk.

Next the storage daemons must be updated with the serializers. This
entails 1) stopping the daemon(s) 2) updating the ivy spec to include your
new module with deserializers 3) resolving and next restarting the daemon.

Henrik BÃ¦rbak should be consulted.

The pre-production environment should be run a couple of days and
resulting data in the MongoDB analyzed to verify that no defects
are present before going to the last stage...

Stage 4: Operations in the production environment
=============

Henrik BÃ¦rbak *must* be involved in this process.

You must be assigned your own project password for access to
the operations RabbitMQ cluster.
