{"name":"Karibu-tutorial","tagline":"The public Karibu tutorial - \"HelloWorld\"","body":"Karibu\r\n===============\r\n\r\n*Welcoming any data, in any format, in any version, at any time...*\r\n\r\nBy *Henrik BÃ¦rbak Christensen, Department of Computer Science, University of Aarhus*.\r\n\r\nKaribu is a high quality data collection framework aiming at data\r\nintegrity, flexibility, and scalability. It is developed for\r\nenvironmental data collection from smartphone apps as well as\r\nstationary sensors, and presently used as the backbone for several\r\nresearch projects on-going at Computer Science, University of Aarhus.\r\n\r\nKaribu consists of a client library that can be deployed on a Java\r\nenabled device (Android phones for instance), and a server side daemon\r\nresponsible for storing incoming data. In addition, a Karibu system\r\nmust have a messaging system (RabbitMQ) and a database (MongoDB)\r\ndeployed.\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n----\r\n\r\nTo get started on the tutorials, you will need Java 1.7+, Ant 1.8+,\r\nIvy 2.4+, and to simulate the distributed environment using the\r\nprovided virtual machines you will need a way to run VMWare virtual\r\nmachines, such as\r\n[VMWare Player](http://www.vmware.com/go/downloadplayer/) for Windows\r\nand Linux, or\r\n[VMWare Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/) for OS X.\r\n\r\nAlso, Ivy will need to download modules so you will have to be on-line\r\nto make the tutorials work.\r\n\r\n\r\nLearning to use Karibu\r\n---\r\n\r\nUsing Karibu for your particular data collection needs requires two\r\nimportant steps\r\n\r\n  1) Configuring Karibu to handle your particular type(s) of\r\n  data. This involves writing implementations of the `Serializer` and\r\n  `Deserializer` interfaces and testing that they work correctly\r\n  together with Karibu. Tutorial: [Hello World](helloworld.md).\r\n\r\n  2) Setting up the distributed Karibu environment which includes\r\n  RabbitMQ, MongoDB, Karibu daemon(s), and the clients. Tutorial:\r\n  [Quick Start](quickstart.md).\r\n\r\nAs Karibu is designed with a lot of flexibility, these two tasks can\r\nactually be made in any order.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe [Hello World](helloworld.md) tutorial focus on the architecture\r\nand the code and configuration options of Karibu in order to develop\r\nthe binding to your particular types of data.\r\n\r\nThe [Quick Start](quickstart.md) tutorial focuses on setting up a\r\nfully distributed environment that contains the core aspects of a full\r\nproduction systems but demonstrates it on a provided, fixed, data\r\ntype.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-55038054-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
